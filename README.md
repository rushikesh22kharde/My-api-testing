# 🚀 API Testing Portfolio

This repository showcases my skills in **API testing** using:
- 🧪 Postman (for designing and running test collections)
- ⚙️ Newman (for CLI automation and reporting)
- 🐍 Python `requests` library (for custom API test scripts)

It demonstrates how to build, automate, and integrate API tests into a CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **/collections** → Postman collections for different APIs (CRUD, authentication, error handling)
- **/environments** → Environment files (dev, staging, prod)
- **/tests** → Python scripts using `requests` + assertions
- **/reports** → Newman HTML/JSON reports
- **/.github/workflows** → GitHub Actions for automated test runs

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Postman** – API test design
- **Newman** – CLI runner + reporting
- **Python requests** – custom API scripts
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD integration
